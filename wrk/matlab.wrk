%matrix declaration
    %denoted by capital letter
    % The ; denotes we are going back to a new row.
    A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9; 10, 11, 12]

%vector
    %matrix of n*1 or 1*n ..... mostly n*1
    %denoted by small letter
    % Initialize a vector 
    v = [1;2;3] 
    rv = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9];
    sub_rv = rv(3:7)
    x = -1:0.1:1    %creates a vector from -1 to 1 with diff of 0.1

% Get the dimension of the matrix A where m = rows and n = columns
    [m,n] = size(A)
    dim_A = size(A)
    num_cols = size(A,2)
    num_rows = size(A,1)

% Now let's index into the 2nd row 3rd column of matrix A
    A_23 = A(2,3)

%join two row matrix
    a = [1 2 3 4]
    b = [5 6 7 8 9]
    c = [a b]
    d = [a'; b']   %join them in column
    
%print all variables
    who

%clear variables
    clear x         % it will delete x, won't display anything
    clear	        %  it will delete all variables in the workspace

%input and outputs
disp 	    % Displays contents of an array or string.
fscanf 	    % Read formatted data from a file.
format 	    % Controls screen-display format.
fprintf 	% Performs formatted writes to screen or file.
input 	    % Displays prompts and waits for input.
; 	        % Suppresses screen printing.

%fscanf and fprintf behaves like scanf and printf in c
%we need to fomat it 
    %s 	Format as a string.
    %d 	Format as an integer.
    %f 	Format as a floating point value.
    %e 	Format as a floating point value in scientific notation.
    %g 	Format in the most compact form: %f or %e.
    \n 	Insert a new line in the output string.
    \t 	Insert a tab in the output string.

%long assignments
initial_velocity = 0;
acceleration = 9.8;
time = 20;
final_velocity = initial_velocity + ...     %i have used ... to extend assignment to nxt line
acceleration * time;
hell = final_velocity


%formats
%you can set format how to display output
format long
format short
format e
format rat   %display ratio
